# DSA-with-cpp

A curated collection of my LeetCode and DSA problem solutions with clean code and optimized approaches.

-> This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms practice solutions, mainly from LeetCode.  
-> I use this repo to track my problem solving journey, improve my coding skills, and maintain clean, well structured implementations of common DSA patterns.
-> The problems are organized by topic such as Arrays, Strings, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Trees, Graphs, Recursion, and Dynamic Programming.  
-> Each solution includes the core logic with an optimized approach and complexity analysis.

This repository also serves as my coding portfolio for internships and software development roles.
